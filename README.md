## 🔍 Model Overview
The model is a custom CNN built with Keras, consisting of:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction

MaxPooling layers for spatial downsampling

Dropout layers for regularization

Dense layers for final classification

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized using the Adam optimizer.


## Results
Training Accuracy: ~XX%

Validation Accuracy: ~YY%

Loss: Converges steadily, indicating good learning behavior

Confusion Matrix and Classification Report included for deeper insights

## Deep Learning Approach
This project leverages deep learning in the following ways:

A CNN is used to automatically learn visual features from images.

Data augmentation is applied to enhance generalization.

The model is trained end-to-end without the need for handcrafted features.

TensorFlow/Keras provides a flexible and modular pipeline for model building and training.


## 🔬 Prediction Analysis
From the model predictions and confusion matrix:

The model performs well on distinct disease classes.

Misclassifications occur between diseases with similar visual features.

Certain classes are underrepresented, leading to bias in predictions.


## Suggestions for Improvement
✅ Use Pre-trained Models: Transfer learning with ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet.

✅ Data Augmentation: More robust transformations to simulate real-world variability.

✅ Class Rebalancing: Address data imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or oversampling.

✅ Model Explainability: Use Grad-CAM to understand what parts of the image the model focuses on.

✅ Hyperparameter Tuning: Apply learning rate schedules, optimizers like RMSprop, or tune epochs.
